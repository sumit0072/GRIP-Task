# The Sparks Foundation
## Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks
This repository consist of the tasks given during my internship at The Sparks Foundation.

### Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
In this task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

To see the implementation check this link - https://github.com/sumit0072/GRIP-Task/tree/main/Task%201-Supervised%20ML

### Task 2 - Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we will predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
