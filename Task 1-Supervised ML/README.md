<h1>Task 1 - Supervised Machine Learning</h1>

<p>Task-1 This task is given by The Sparks Foundation in <b>Graduate Rotational Internship Program</b>.</p>

<h2>Simple Linear Regression</h2>

<p>In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.</p>

<blockquote><B>Question</B> : What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dataset is consist of only two variables:
            <ol>
                <li>Hours : The number of hours students studied.</li>
                <li>Scores : The percentage scores obtained by students.</li>
            </ol>
